abstract = {{Since 2013, the National Malaria Control Programme in mainland Tanzania has deployed annual distributions of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) through primary schools to maintain ITN access and use. This School Net Programme (SNP) is slated to be used throughout mainland Tanzania by 2023. This modelling study projects ITN access under different ITN distribution strategies and quantification approaches. A stock and flow model with a Tanzania-specific ITN decay rate was used to calculate annual net crops for four different ITN distribution strategies, varying quantification approaches within each strategy. Annual nets-per-capita (NPC) was derived from net crop and a standardized population projection. Nonparametric conditional quartile functions for the proportion of the population with access to an ITN (ITN access) as a function of NPC were used to predict ITN access and its variability. The number of ITNs required under the varying quantification approaches for the period 2022–2030 was calculated. Annual SNP quantified using a “population times 15\%” approach maintained ITN access between 80 and 90\%, when combined with reproductive and child health (RCH) ITN distribution, requiring 133.2 million ITNs. The same strategy quantified with “population times 22\%” maintained ITN access at or above 90\%, requiring 175.5 million ITNs. Under 5-year mass campaigns with RCH distribution for pregnant women and infants, ITN access reached 90\% post-campaign and fell to 27–35\% in the 4th year post-campaign, requiring 120.5 million ITNs over 8 years. 3-yearly mass campaigns with RCH reached 100\% ITN access post-campaign and fell to 70\% in the 3rd year post-campaign, requiring 154.4 million ITNs. Given an ITN retention time in Tanzania of 2.15 years, the model predicts that mass campaigns conducted every 3 years in mainland Tanzania will not maintain ITN access at target levels of 80\%, even with strong RCH channels. Mainland Tanzania can however expect to maintain ITN access at 80\% or above by quantifying SNP using “population × 15\%”, in addition to RCH ITN delivery. This strategy requires 14\% fewer ITNs than a 3-year campaign strategy while providing more consistent ITN coverage. Meeting the targets of 80\% ITN use would require maintaining 90\% ITN access, achievable using a “population times 22\%” quantification approach for SNP.

abstract = {{BACKGROUND:Tanzania achieved universal coverage with long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) in October 2011, after three years of free mass net distribution campaigns and is now faced with the challenge of maintaining high coverage as nets wear out and the population grows. A process of exploring options for a continuous or "Keep-Up" distribution system was initiated in early 2011. This paper presents for the first time a comprehensive national process to review the major considerations, findings and recommendations for the implementation of a new strategy. 
METHODS:Stakeholder meetings and site visits were conducted in five locations in Tanzania to garner stakeholder input on the proposed distribution systems. Coverage levels for LLINs and their decline over time were modelled using NetCALC software, taking realistic net decay rates, current demographic profiles and other relevant parameters into consideration. Costs of the different distribution systems were estimated using local data.

RESULTS:LLIN delivery was considered via mass campaigns, Antenatal Care-Expanded Programme on Immunization (ANC/EPI), community-based distribution, schools, the commercial sector and different combinations of the above. Most approaches appeared unlikely to maintain universal coverage when used alone. Mass campaigns, even when combined with a continuation of the Tanzania National Voucher Scheme (TNVS), would produce large temporal fluctuations in coverage levels; over 10 years this strategy would require 63.3 million LLINs and a total cost of \$444 million USD. Community mechanisms, while able to deliver the required numbers of LLINs, would require a massive scale-up in monitoring, evaluation and supervision systems to ensure accurate application of identification criteria at the community level. School-based approaches combined with the existing TNVS would reach most Tanzanian households and deliver 65.4 million LLINs over 10 years at a total cost of \$449 million USD and ensure continuous coverage. The cost of each strategy was largely driven by the number of LLINs delivered.

CONCLUSIONS:The most cost-efficient strategy to maintain universal coverage is one that best optimizes the numbers of LLINs needed over time. A school-based approach using vouchers targeting all students in Standards 1, 3, 5, 7 and Forms 1 and 2 in combination with the TNVS appears to meet best the criteria of effectiveness, equity and efficiency.}},

Using data from multiple sources, we generate high-resolution maps of ITN access, use, and nets-per-capita annually from 2000 to 2020 across the 40 highest-burden African countries. Our findings support several existing hypotheses: that use is high among those with access, that nets are discarded more quickly than official policy presumes, and that effectively distributing nets grows more difficult as coverage increases. The primary driving factors behind these findings are most likely strong cultural and social messaging around the importance of net use, low physical net durability, and a mixture of inherent commodity distribution challenges and less-than-optimal net allocation policies, respectively. These results can inform both policy decisions and downstream malaria analyses. Insecticide treated nets (ITNs) are an important part of malaria control in Africa and WHO targets aim for 80\% coverage. This study estimates the spatio-temporal access and use of ITNs in Africa from 2000-2020, and shows that both metrics have improved over time but access remains below WHO targets.}},

While the insecticidal durability of LLINs is around 3 years, nets are commonly discarded 2 years post distribution. This study investigated the factors associated with the decision of users to discard LLINs. A mixed-method sequential explanatory approach using a structured questionnaire followed by focus group discussions (FGDs) to collect information on experiences, views, reasons, how and when LLINs are discarded. Out of 6,526 households that responded to the questionnaire of LLINs durability trial, 160 households were randomly selected from the households in four villages in Bagamoyo Tanzania for FGDs but only 155 households participated in the FGDs. Five of the household representatives couldn’t participate due to unexpected circumstances. A total of sixteen FGDs each comprising of 8–10 adults were conducted; older women (40–60 years), older men (40–60 years), younger women (18–39 years), younger men (18–39 years). During the FGDs, participants visually inspected seven samples of LLINs that were “too-torn” based on Proportionate Hole Index recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines on LLIN testing, the nets were brought to the discussion and participants had to determine if such LLINs were to be kept or discarded. The study assessed responses from the same participants that attended FGD and also responded to the structured questionnaire, 117 participants fulfilled the criteria, thus data from only 117 participants are analysed in this study. In FGDs, integrity of LLIN influenced the decision to discard or keep a net. Those of older age, women, and householders with lower income were more likely to classify a WHO “too-torn” net as “good”. The common methods used to discard LLINs were burning and burying. The findings were seen in the quantitative analysis. For every additional hole, the odds of discarding a WHO “too-torn” LLIN increased [OR = 1.05 (95\%CI (1.04–1.07)), p < 0.001]. Younger age group [OR = 4.97 (95\%CI (3.25–7.32)), p < 0.001], male-headed households [OR = 6.85 (95\%CI (4.44 –10.59)), p < 0.001], and wealthy households [OR = 3.88 (95\%CI (2.33–6.46)), p < 0.001] were more likely to discard LLINs. Integrity of LLIN was the main determinant for discarding or keeping LLINs and the decision to discard the net is associated with socioeconomic status of the household, and the age and gender of respondents. WHO “too torn” nets are encouraged to be used instead of none until replacement, and disposal of nets should be based on recommendation.

abstract = {{Two billion long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) have been procured for malaria control. A functional LLIN is one that is present, is in good physical condition, and remains insecticidal, thereby providing protection against vector-borne diseases through preventing bites and killing disease vectors. The World Health Organization (WHO) prequalifies LLINs that remain adequately insecticidal 3 years after deployment. Therefore, institutional buyers often assume that prequalified LLINs are functionally identical with a 3-year lifespan. We measured the lifespans of 3 LLIN products, and calculated their cost per year of functional life, to demonstrate the economic and public health importance of procuring the most cost-effective LLIN product based on its lifespan. A randomised double-blinded trial of 3 pyrethroid LLIN products (10,571 nets in total) was conducted at 3 follow-up points: 10 months (August–October 2014), 22 months (August–October 2015), and 36 months (October–December 2016) among 3,393 households in Tanzania using WHO-recommended methods. Primary outcome was LLIN functional survival (LLIN present and in serviceable condition). Secondary outcomes were (1) bioefficacy and chemical content (residual insecticidal activity) and (2) protective efficacy for volunteers sleeping under the LLINs (bite reduction and mosquitoes killed). Median LLIN functional survival was significantly different between the 3 net products (p = 0.001): 2.0 years (95\% CI 1.7–2.3) for Olyset, 2.5 years (95\% CI 2.2–2.8) for PermaNet 2.0 (hazard ratio [HR] 0.73 [95\% CI 0.64–0.85], p = 0.001), and 2.6 years (95\% CI 2.3–2.8) for NetProtect (HR = 0.70 [95\% CI 0.62–0.77], p < 0.001). Functional survival was affected by accumulation of holes, leading to users discarding nets. Protective efficacy also significantly differed between products as they aged. Equivalent annual cost varied between US\$1.2 (95\% CI \$1.1–\$1.4) and US\$1.5 (95\% CI \$1.3–\$1.7), assuming that each net was priced identically at US\$3. The 2 longer-lived nets (PermaNet and NetProtect) were 20\% cheaper than the shorter-lived product (Olyset). The trial was limited to only the most widely sold LLINs in Tanzania. Functional survival varies by country, so the single country setting is a limitation. These results suggest that LLIN functional survival is less than 3 years and differs substantially between products, and these differences strongly influence LLIN value for money. LLIN tendering processes should consider local expectations of cost per year of functional life and not unit price. As new LLIN products come on the market, especially those with new insecticides, it will be imperative to monitor their comparative durability to ensure that the most cost-effective products are procured for malaria control.}},

This study assessed how nets are allocated within households to individuals of different age categories as ITNs are lost or damaged and as new ITNs are obtained. The study also explored how ITN allocation affects ITN durability. A cross-sectional household survey and ITN durability study was conducted among 2,875 households across Tanzania to determine the proportion of nets that remain protective (serviceable) 22 months after net distribution aiming for universal coverage. Allocation of study nets within houses, and re-allocation of ITNs when new universal replacement campaign (URC) nets arrived in study households in Musoma District, was also assessed. Some 57.0\% (95\% CI 53.9–60.1\%) of households had sufficient ITNs for every household member, while 84.4\% (95\% CI 82.4–86.4\%) of the population had access to an ITN within their household (assuming 1 net covers every 2 members). In households with sufficient nets, 77.5\% of members slept under ITNs. In households without sufficient nets, pregnant women (54.6\%), children < 5 years (45.8\%) and adults (42.1\%) were prioritized, with fewer school-age children 5–14 years (35.9\%), youths 15–24 years (28.1\%) and seniors > 65 years (32.6\%) sleeping under ITNs. Crowding (≥ 3 people sleeping under nets) was twice as common among people residing in houses without sufficient nets for all age groups, apart from children < 5. Nets were less likely to be serviceable if: ≥ 3 people slept under them (OR 0.50 (95\% CI 0.40–0.63)), or if nets were used by school-age children (OR 0.72 (95\% CI 0.56–0.93)), or if the net product was Olyset®. One month after the URC, only 23.6\% (95\% CI 16.7–30.6\%) of the population had access to a URC ITN in Musoma district. Householders in Musoma district continued the use of old ITNs even with the arrival of new URC nets. Users determined the useful life of ITNs and prioritized pregnant women and children < 5 to serviceable ITNs. When household net access declines, users adjust by crowding under remaining nets, which further reduces ITN lifespan. School-age children that commonly harbour gametocytes that mediate malaria transmission are compelled to sleep under unserviceable nets, crowd under nets or remain uncovered. However, they were accommodated by the arrival of new nets. More frequent ITN delivery through the school net programme in combination with mass distribution campaigns is essential to maximize ITN effectiveness.}},

abstract = {{Abstract Background In Ethiopia, despite improvements in coverage and access, utilization of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) remains a challenge. Different household-level factors have been identified as associated with LLIN use. However, the contribution of LLIN physical integrity to their utilization is not well investigated and documented. This study aimed to assess the association between the physical integrity of LLINs and their use. Methods This study employed a nested case-control design using secondary data from the Ethiopian LLIN durability monitoring study conducted from May 2015 to June 2018. LLINs not used the night before the survey were identified as cases, while those used the previous night were categorized as controls. The physical integrity of LLINs was classified as no holes, good, acceptable, and torn using the proportionate hole index (pHI). A Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE) model was used to assess and quantify the association between LLIN physical integrity and use. The model specifications included binomial probabilistic distribution, logit link, exchangeable correlation matrix structure, and robust standard errors. The factors included in the model were selected first by fitting binary regression, and then by including all factors that showed statistical significance at P -value less than 0.25 and conceptually relevant variables into the multivariate regression model. Results A total of 5277 observations fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Out of these 1767 observations were cases while the remaining 3510 were controls. LLINs that were in torn physical condition had higher odds (AOR [95\% CI] = 1.76 [1.41, 2.19]) of not being used compared to LLINs with no holes. Other factors that showed significant association included the age of the LLIN, sleeping place type, washing status of LLINs, perceptions towards net care and repair, LLIN to people ratio, economic status, and study site. Conclusion and recommendation LLINs that have some level of physical damage have a relatively higher likelihood of not being used. Community members need to be educated about proper care and prevention of LLIN damage to delay the development of holes as long as possible and use available LLINs regularly.}},

Their effectiveness, however, depends on if and how they are used, making ‘compliance’ (and the social factors affecting it) a key area of interest for research on malaria transmission. This article situates the notion of compliance with ‘bednet use’ within everyday practices in an area of south-west Burkina Faso with high malaria transmission. By drawing on ethnographic fieldwork conducted between 2017 and 2018, it critically describes the precarious micro-environments that foreground bednet use—from gender and age to the means of (re)production of social and labour conditions—and assesses the bednets’ effectiveness and community uptake. Bednet use stems from concrete, ordinary dynamics that interweave only apparently at the margins of the time individuals most need to be protected by a net. This work conceptualises ‘compliance’ beyond binary indicators of intervention uptake and locates ‘use’ as the result of contingent assemblages.}},

However, national level campaigns in several countries have run out of nets in the course of distribution, indicating a problem in the method used to estimate the quantity needed. A major reason for the shortfall in estimation is the mismatch between the quantification factor used to plan procurement and the allocation algorithm used at community level, in particular the effect of needing to add an additional net to households with an odd number of inhabitants. To solve this problem a revised quantification factor is suggested. Based on data from a broad range of household surveys across Africa, the effect of odd-numbered households on numbers of nets distributed is estimated via two frequently used allocation methods. The impact of these algorithms on the proportion of households reaching a person to net ratio of 2:1, a frequently used marker of universal coverage is then calculated. In order to avoid stock-outs of nets during national coverage campaigns, it is recommended to use a quantification factor of 1.78 people per net, with an additional allocation factor suggested to account for other common problems at the community level resulting in a final recommended ratio of 1.60 people per net. It is also recommend that community level allocation procedures be aligned with procurement estimates to reduce shortages of nets during campaign distributions. These analyses should enable programme managers to make evidence-based decisions and support a more efficient and effective use of LLIN distribution campaign resources.}},

This School Net Programme (SNP) is slated to be used throughout mainland Tanzania by 2023. This modelling study projects ITN access under different ITN distribution strategies and quantification approaches. A stock and flow model with a Tanzania-specific ITN decay rate was used to calculate annual net crops for four different ITN distribution strategies, varying quantification approaches within each strategy. Annual nets-per-capita (NPC) was derived from net crop and a standardized population projection. Nonparametric conditional quartile functions for the proportion of the population with access to an ITN (ITN access) as a function of NPC were used to predict ITN access and its variability. The number of ITNs required under the varying quantification approaches for the period 2022–2030 was calculated. Annual SNP quantified using a “population times 15\%” approach maintained ITN access between 80 and 90\%, when combined with reproductive and child health (RCH) ITN distribution, requiring 133.2 million ITNs. The same strategy quantified with “population times 22\%” maintained ITN access at or above 90\%, requiring 175.5 million ITNs. Under 5-year mass campaigns with RCH distribution for pregnant women and infants, ITN access reached 90\% post-campaign and fell to 27–35\% in the 4th year post-campaign, requiring 120.5 million ITNs over 8 years. 3-yearly mass campaigns with RCH reached 100\% ITN access post-campaign and fell to 70\% in the 3rd year post-campaign, requiring 154.4 million ITNs. Given an ITN retention time in Tanzania of 2.15 years, the model predicts that mass campaigns conducted every 3 years in mainland Tanzania will not maintain ITN access at target levels of 80\%, even with strong RCH channels. Mainland Tanzania can however expect to maintain ITN access at 80\% or above by quantifying SNP using “population × 15\%”, in addition to RCH ITN delivery. This strategy requires 14\% fewer ITNs than a 3-year campaign strategy while providing more consistent ITN coverage. Meeting the targets of 80\% ITN use would require maintaining 90\% ITN access, achievable using a “population times 22\%” quantification approach for SNP.

To evaluate the epidemiology of both Plasmodium falciparum infection and malaria disease, the Malawi International Center of Excellence for Malaria Research (ICEMR) has developed and implemented diverse and robust surveillance and research projects. Descriptive studies in ICEMR Phase 1 increased our understanding of the declining effectiveness of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs), the role of school-age children in malaria parasite transmission, and the complexity of host–parasite interactions leading to disease. These findings informed the design of ICEMR Phase 2 to test hypotheses about LLIN use and effectiveness, vector resistance to insecticides, demographic targets of malaria control, patterns and causes of asymptomatic to life-threatening disease, and the impacts of RTS,S vaccination plus piperonyl butoxide-treated LLINs on infection and disease in young children. These investigations are helping us to understand mosquito-to-human and human-to-mosquito transmission in the context of Malawi's intransigent malaria problem.}},

Progress toward elimination may require effective targeting of specific human populations that act as key transmission reservoirs. Parameterized using molecular-based Plasmodium falciparum infection data from cross-sectional community studies in southern Malawi, a simulation model was developed to predict the proportions of human-to-mosquito transmission arising from (a) children under 5 years old (U5s), (b) school-age children (SAC, 5–15 years), (c) young adults (16–30 years), and (d) adults > 30 years. The model incorporates mosquito biting heterogeneity and differential infectivity (i.e. probability that a blood-fed mosquito develops oocysts) by age and gametocyte density. The model predicted that SAC were responsible for more than 60\% of new mosquito infections in both dry and rainy seasons, even though they comprise only 30\% of this southern Malawi population. Young adults were the second largest contributors, while U5s and adults over 30 were each responsible for < 10\% of transmission. While the specific predicted values are sensitive to the relative infectiousness of SAC, this group remained the most important contributor to mosquito infections under all realistic estimates. These results suggest that U5 children play a small role compared to SAC in maintaining P. falciparum transmission in southern Malawi. Models that assume biting homogeneity overestimate the importance of U5s. To reduce transmission, interventions will need to reach more SAC and young adults. This publicly available model can be used by others to estimate age-specific transmission contributions in epidemiologically similar sites with local parameter estimates of P. falciparum prevalence and bed net use.}},

Schools have been identified as one potential channel for continuous distribution of LLIN. This research aims to evaluate an annual school based LLIN distribution programme in Tanzania which began in 2013, called the School Net Programme (SNP). Following each of the first four rounds of SNP distribution, a household survey was conducted in intervention and comparison districts in Southern and Lake zones of Tanzania (N = 5083 households). Measures of ownership, access, and use were compared between intervention and comparison districts. Determinants of reach were assessed in intervention districts. Population access to an LLIN increased from 63.1\% (95\% CI: 58.8, 67.5) to 76.5\% (95\% CI: 72.9, 80.0) in the intervention districts between the first and last surveys. Access also rose in the comparison districts from 51.4\% (95\% CI: 46.9, 55.9) to 79.8\% (95\% CI: 77.3, 82.0) following a mass distribution and implementation of school-based distribution during the study period. LLIN use increased in intervention districts from 44.9\% (95\% CI: 40.5, 49.3) to 65.6\% (95\% CI: 59.4, 71.8) and from 57.2\% (95\% CI: 49.7, 64.7) to 77.4\% (95\% CI: 69.3, 85.5) specifically amongst primary school-aged children. Households reached by the SNP were wealthier households with children enrolled in school. The SNP in Tanzania was able to maintain population level LLIN ownership, use, and access in the absence of a mass distribution. The SNP successfully reached households which housed school-aged children. Alternative delivery strategies may need to be considered to reach households without children enrolled in school which experienced less benefit from the program.}},

Since the implementation of the Tanzania National Voucher Scheme in 2004 and mass-distribution campaigns in 2009-2011 and 2015-2016, Tanzania has been committed to finding new and innovative ways of achieving and maintaining universal bed net coverage. Planning for the School Net Programme (SNP) began in 2011 and in 2013, the country piloted a SNP in three regions. Nets were distributed annually to children attending schools in selected primary and secondary grades. Intra-family re-distribution was assumed, and hence the family as a whole, rather than just the children themselves, were the targeted beneficiaries. The programme has since expanded to 14 regions and has seen six rounds of annual distribution. In its fifth year, 3 million nets were distributed at a cost of USD 3.64 per net and USD 0.60 per person-year of protection (including the net). ITN access and use were maintained at a high level (\textbackslashtextasciitilde 50-75\%) over the first 4 years of distribution within selected evaluation areas, even in the absence of a mass distribution event. Net distribution through primary schools has proven to be a feasible and effective strategy for maintaining consistently high coverage in Tanzania.}},

abstract = {{Quantile regression, as introduced by Koenker and Bassett (1978), may be viewed as an extension of classical least squares estimation of conditional mean models to the estimation of an ensemble of models for several conditional quantile functions. The central special case is the median regression estimator which minimizes a sum of absolute errors. Other conditional quantile functions are estimated by minimizing an asymmetrically weighted sum of absolute errors. Quantile regression methods are illustrated with applications to models for CEO pay, food expenditure, and infant birthweight.}},

abstract = {{Long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) are expected to last for at least 3 years, but whilst this may be achieved from an insecticidal perspective, physical protection is frequently compromised much earlier because of the rapid accumulation of holes during use. To understand why LLINs are so susceptible to loss of physical integrity, thousands of hole damage sites in LLINs retrieved from the field in Africa and Asia were forensically studied to identify the persistent underlying causes. A total of 525 LLINs consisting of six different brands from five different countries across Africa and Asia were collected from the field after 1 to 3 years in use. More than 42,000 individual sites of hole damage were analysed based on the morphology and size of each individual hole, aided by optical microscopy (OM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The fracture morphology enabled positive identification of the underlying mechanisms of the damage. Across all LLINs and geographical settings, mechanical damage is the primary cause of holes and loss of physical integrity in LLINs (63.14\% by frequency and 81.52\% by area). Snagging is the single most frequent mechanical damage mechanism, whilst the largest sized holes in LLINs result from seam failure and tearing. Abrasion and hole enlargement are also responsible for a progressive loss in the physical integrity of nets. Collectively, these five modes of mechanical damage can be expected to result from normal use of LLINs by households. Evidence of deliberate cutting, burn holes and rodent damage was observed to a lesser degree, which LLINs are not designed to withstand. Loss of physical integrity in LLINs is an inevitable consequence of using a vector control product that has an inherently low resistance to mechanical damage during normal use. To improve performance, new specifications based on laboratory textile testing is needed, to assess the resistance of LLIN products to the primary causes of mechanical damage when in use, which are snagging, tearing, abrasion and hole enlargement. Seam construction also needs to meet a revised minimum standard to reduce the risk of a rapid loss of physical integrity during use.}},
